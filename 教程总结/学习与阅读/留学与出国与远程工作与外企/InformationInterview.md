Information Interview（也称为Information Conversation）并不是工作面试（Job Interview），而是求职者与行业中人（insider）的互动。
它的目的并不在于获得聘用机会，而主要在于了解insider个人的职业生涯、企业发展和行业趋势等信息，以便对相关行业发展和个人职业定位
等有更清楚的认知和准备，而如果能从中发现潜在工作机会和得到推荐信（Referral），那就是再好不过了。

如何展开有效的Information Interview？首先是找到这样的联系对象。寻找的途径多种多样，如在一些社交或职场活动中拿到的名片，
教授或亲友的推荐，从学校职业中心拿到的校友联系方式，刊登的企业信息等，或是线上的职业社交媒体，如最常用的LinkedIn。

其次就是开始建立起联系并约定Information Interview。方式主要有两种，一是写邮件，二是打电话。写邮件是比较受推荐的方法，
可以在邮件里充分准备措辞，比较礼貌也不至于打扰对方。当然，不管是邮件还是电话，联系成功的概率不会太高（除非是有人推荐的联系），
这在很大程度上也看每个人的社交能力。另外，作为Linkedin的Premium会员，也可以通过这个平台建立联系的（在国外求职或职场发展，
Linkedin已经是必不可少的一个重要的途径了，必须学会有效利用）

最后就是约定Information Interview后的沟通交流。面试一般是别人问你问题来考察你的能力，而Information Interview是
你问别人问题来了解相关情况，所以提问的能力是最重要的。对很多华裔人士而言，提问的能力往往比回答问题的能力更弱，
所以必须事先做好认真的准备和模拟练习，使得每一次来之不易的Information Interview能让见面的双方都有收获，这才是成功的。

在哪里求职或升职都不容易，但如有这种Information Interview的能力，并能有10次以上成功的Information Interview机会，
那么好工作（或者升迁变动）一定就会呼之欲出、芝麻开门的。

Job Seeking

I heard that it was not easy to find a job in Canada when I was considering immigration; however, 
I would like to have more life experience and better education for my daughter.To find a job or not find a job? 
This is a question. In the end, the dream surpassed worries. After landing in Canada in three years, 
I got my first job through education, volunteer experience and networking.

Education is an engine to start a job seeking journey.Proverb says: no diamond, no more porcelain work, 
which means capability is a necessary premise to a job. Due to my immigration identity, 
I persuaded myself to get back high school for qualifying a decent Canadian job. I was especially
beneficial from English 10, 11, and 12. The reason is that I not only improved my language ability, 
but also identify the ideology between two countries. In addition, I joined “Mosaic Employment Program”. 
MOSAIC has 40 years of experience providing service to newcomers to integrate into Canada and the Canadian labor market. 
Through this program, I had a chance to reflect my personality dimension and skills for job matching,
and learned how to analyze accomplishments, to write resume, cover letter, business letters, to mock an interview,
to follow workplace etiquette and conversations, which are all crucial elements for job preparation.

Volunteer/internship experience is an indispensable step towards the first job in Canada. 
By contrast with recruitment in China, Canadian companies emphasized on individual’s work achievement rather 
than high academic level, but how to kick off the first work experience? Volunteer is a good way. 
My first volunteer job was a Global Academic program coordinator at UBC Continuing Studies. 
I found out this volunteer leadership program by Go Volunteer website. By recognition and recommendation 
of this program’s supervisor, I began my second volunteer at Beaty Biodiversity Museum in UBC, 
which enhanced my resume and gained reference. Afterwards, I volunteered as a women social club leader,
a co-chair at School Parent Council. Volunteer experience helped me to transfer my education and soft skills 
to workplace, to build a solid foundation for real work.

Networking plays a vital role in getting the job offer.According to a report from ABC News, 
80 percentage of today’s jobs are landed through networking. Personal networking will lead to true results rather 
than spending most of your time on CareerBuilder.com, Monster.com, Indeed.com and other job boards. 
Personal networking includes joining various events, where entrepreneurs, investors, professionals showed up; 
or taking advantage of your existing network of family members, relatives, friends, ex-colleagues, 
neighbors and others; or starting to establish your own networking. Meanwhile, 
information interview provides current and specific Information about a career field. 
Information interview is an informal conversation you can have with someone working in an area of interest to you.
I participated in a YWCA information interview program and got 4-5 information interviews which were
fundamental for me to make a final decision of my job.

Everyone needs a job to be independent, either in your hometown, or in the immigrated country. 
If you want to seek jobs in Canada, local education, volunteer/internship and networking are my personal 
recommendation for your reference.
