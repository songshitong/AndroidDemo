https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions
In computing, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) is a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction
set extension to the x86 architecture, designed by Intel and introduced in 1999 in their Pentium III
series of central processing units (CPUs) shortly after the appearance of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD's) 3DNow!.
SSE contains 70 new instructions (65 unique mnemonics using 70 encodings), most of which work on single
precision floating-point data. SIMD instructions can greatly increase performance when exactly the same
operations are to be performed on multiple data objects. Typical applications are digital signal
processing and graphics processing.
