keep a changelog
Don’t let your friends dump git logs into changelogs.

What is a changelog?
A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

Why keep a changelog?
To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between 
  each release (or version) of the project.
